2. Make sure code works with different fiber size
3. Cleanup old comments and unused variables/module calls


Instructions for use:

1. Run code initially
2. Code will ask for user name in c:/Users/ directory
3. Then put the date level data folders (e.g. 20230113) into the created "Data Directory" folder on the pc desktop
4. Type 'y' into the input in terminal after the check and press enter to continue the code
